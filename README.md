Movie Genre Classification Project

-Objective: To classify movies into their respective genres based on plot summaries or other textual information using machine learning techniques.

-Overview: Build a machine-learning model to automate genre classification. Utilize natural language processing (NLP) to process and analyse text data.

-Dataset Name: Genre Classification Dataset from IMDb

-Techniques Used:

o Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization.

o Feature Extraction: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)

o Machine Learning Models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM)

o Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

-Result: An efficient and scalable solution for predicting movie genres with high performance across evaluation metrics.

Accuracy: 58%
